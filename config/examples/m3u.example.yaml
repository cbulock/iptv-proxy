  # ============================================================================
  # Local File Sources (for testing or offline use)
  # ============================================================================
  
  # Local M3U file (relative to project root)
  # Note: Use file:// URLs for local files
  # - name: "Local Playlist"
  #   url: "file://./data/local-channels.m3u"
  #   type: "m3u"
  
  # ============================================================================
  # Edge Cases and Advanced Scenarios
  # ============================================================================
  
  # Source with special characters in name (will be used as group-title)
  # - name: "Kids & Family"
  #   url: "https://family-content.com/channels.m3u"
  #   type: "m3u"
  
  # Source behind a reverse proxy with custom port
  # - name: "Proxied Service"
  #   url: "https://proxy.example.com:8443/iptv/playlist.m3u"
  #   type: "m3u"
  
  # Source with self-signed certificate (may require additional configuration)
  # - name: "Self-Signed HTTPS"
  #   url: "https://self-signed.local/playlist.m3u"
  #   type: "m3u"

# ============================================================================
# Configuration Notes:
# ============================================================================
# 
# - Each source must have a unique "name" - this becomes the group-title in the output
# - The "type" field is optional and defaults to "m3u" if omitted
# - HDHomeRun devices must use type "hdhomerun"
# - For HDHomeRun, the URL should point to the device's base URL (no /lineup.json path needed)
# - All channels from each source will be tagged with the source name
# - Use channel-map.yaml to normalize channel metadata across sources
# - Sources are processed sequentially in the order listed
# - If a source fails to load, it will be skipped with a warning
# 
# ============================================================================
# Troubleshooting:
# ============================================================================
# 
# - "Failed to fetch M3U": Check URL accessibility and network connectivity
# - "Missing URL for source": Ensure each source has a valid URL field
# - HDHomeRun not working: Verify device is on the network and accessible
# - Authentication issues: Ensure credentials are properly URL-encoded
# - Timeout errors: Check if the source server is responsive
#
